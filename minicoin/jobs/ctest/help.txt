Runs ctest in the build path matching the current host directory

The highest-level build tree that matches the current working
directory of the host will be used as the working directory on the
guest, defaulting to any directory for which a -build path exists.
E.g. for a host path ~/qt/dev/qtbase/tests, a the guest paths
~/qt-build/dev/qtbase/tests, ~/qt/dev-build/qtbase/tests,
~/qt/dev/qtbase-build/tests and so forth will be tried, and the
first existing path will be used to navigate further down into the
matching sub directory.

--build NAME

  Overrides the default build tree

--testargs ARGS

  Sets the TESTARGS environment variable before calling ctest

-- CTESTARGS

  Arguments following a -- after the machine(s) name will be passed
  through to ctest.
