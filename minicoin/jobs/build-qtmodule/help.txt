Configures and builds the Qt module from the sources in the current directory

If the Qt module is "qtbase", the job generates a helper script on the guest
that runs "qmake" and "cmake" for this build. Other modules and projects can
then use those scripts.

The build directory on the guest is by default ~/[module]-build

The build job supports Qt 5 (using qmake/make) and Qt 6 (using cmake/ninja).

By default, the job configures Qt with

-confirm-license -developer-build -opensource -nomake examples

and builds the src directory (as well the qmake target for Qt 6).

Supported job parameters:

--configure "configure-line": overrides the default

--target: other target than src/all (or sub-src for Qt 5)

--build: a suffix for the build directory
